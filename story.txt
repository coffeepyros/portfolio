### WHO AM I? ###

I work as some sort of project manager in a museum.

### WHAT DO I WANT? ###

I need someone to develop a (mobile) website accompanying a new exhibition.

### HOW DO I GET TO THE WEBSITE? ###

I have a physical folder with business cards and a virtual folder with emails from possible collaborators / IT experts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E-Mail: Hi, we met at event XYZ half a year ago and I gave you my business card. In the last months I did some new cool projects, that you might want to check out. (link)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### WHAT SHOULD I DO / FEEL IN THE END? ###

I'm sure that this guy is the right person for the job. He can code, he has an understanding of the physical space of a museum, he has some sort of interest/experience with educational content, he is available, he can travel to our museum.

### THE STORY ###

I am a project manager (or do HR related tasks in addition to my normal job) in a creative and educational enviroment. The staff of the museum isn't that big. Some people have to do multiple things at once.

For a new exhibition we need an accompanying webpage with interactive elements. Also some sort of social media integration is vital.

I have a project folder with emails from web developers and want to see if one of them suits the new project.

The first thing I read is "I build mobile websites" and there's no confusing technical jargon like "HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP" etc. I don't feel overwhelmed. I wonder what the mobile websites look like and work, that this guy built.

I scroll down a bit and right there, are links to the latest projects. I can view them in more detail, with the requirements and some nicely and clearly presented images. There are also images showing how the website looks on desktop and mobile view.

I can see that he worked with museums (or in the educational sector) before.

Now I'm wondering if the person is available and if he'll be able to visit the museum. 
-> Based in Leipzig, love to meet in person at your location / the physical space can inform the virtual space.
